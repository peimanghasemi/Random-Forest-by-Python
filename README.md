**Return Prediction using Random Forest**
This repository contains a simple Python implementation of return prediction using a Random Forest model.
The script uses historical stock price data to construct basic lag and rolling features and evaluates the predictions using standard error metrics and a simple rule-based strategy.
The code is intended as a small demonstration related to my research on return prediction and portfolio decision-making.
